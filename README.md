Camp-Today Project 🏕️ | Node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Rest API, Authentication

As the driving force behind the Camp-Today project, I architected a dynamic campground-sharing platform equipped with essential user authentication, search, and secure payment functionalities.

Project Highlights:
🚀 Engineered a feature-rich web application empowering users to discover and share campgrounds seamlessly.
💡 Leveraged a tech stack of HTML, CSS, EJS for front-end, and Node.js, Express, Passport for back-end, bolstered by MongoDB for robust data management.
💳 Integrated Stripe API to facilitate seamless and secure payment transactions, enabling user interactions like liking, commenting, and rating.
🔒 Implemented admin preferences and a secure email-based password reset mechanism to enhance user security and account management.

This project was a pivotal opportunity for me to combine my technical skills with creative problem-solving, delivering an exceptional user experience in the process."


💡 Lessons Learned / Technologies Used
MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to achieve seperation of concerns and maintain independence in relation to backend/frontend services.
Express.js minimal, unopinionated backend framework to keep serverside boilerplate as low as possible. Especially useful for learning how to piece different technologies together to develop a complete backend.
Express-Session to learn how cookies work to deliver a rich user experience through client and serverside cookies.
Passport.js for authentication and authorization.
MongoDB as the primary NoSQL database to store campgrounds, users, reviews and session details.
Mongoose as an ORM(Object relation mapping) library to interact with MongoDB.
Cloudinary to store images of campgrounds when users create new campgrounds, and to optimize them for when client-side requests them.
Mapbox to deliver an interactive map for users to visually see the location of campgrounds through a cluster map and a zoomed in map for each campground.
EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates) as a templating language to create dynamic user experices.
Bootstrap as the driving CSS framework to create visually appealing user experiences.
Render to host the complete application
